## Phase 4 Lessons Learned

### What Went Exceptionally Well

**Architecture Decision: Option B (Multiple LoadBalancer IPs)**
- Direct IP:port access eliminated DNS complexity
- Protocol flexibility critical for Plex port 32400 and qBittorrent torrent ports
- Simplified troubleshooting (each service has unique IP)
- MetalLB Layer 2 mode rock-solid (no IP assignment issues after pool expansion)
- No single point of failure (no shared Ingress controller dependency)

**LinuxServer.io Docker Images**
- lscr.io/linuxserver/* images deployed flawlessly via YAML manifests
- Consistent PUID/PGID pattern across all services (simplified permissions)
- Automatic API key generation on first startup (no manual secret creation)
- Excellent documentation and community support

**Prowlarr Indexer Sync**
- Automatic indexer push to all *arr services worked perfectly
- Single configuration point (Prowlarr) propagated to 3 *arr services
- 3 Usenet indexers (NZBgeek, NZBFinder, abNZB) synced in seconds
- Zero manual indexer configuration in Radarr/Sonarr/Lidarr

**Dual Download Clients Strategy**
- qBittorrent (torrents) + SABnzbd (Usenet) provides flexibility
- Category system (movies/tv/music) enables intelligent routing
- Both clients integrated seamlessly with all *arr services

**NFS Persistent Storage**
- ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode critical for multi-pod access
- NFS CSI provisioner from Phase 2 worked flawlessly
- 10Ti media-storage PVC and 50Gi media-configs PVC bound immediately
- Config persistence across pod restarts validated multiple times

### Critical Issues Identified and Resolved

**Issue #1: NFS SubPath Mount Failures (CRITICAL)**
- **Problem:** Pods stuck in ContainerCreating for 40+ minutes
- **Root Cause:** Multiple subPath mounts of same PVC caused Kubernetes mount conflicts
- **Error:** `failed to process volumes=[downloads]: context deadline exceeded`
- **Resolution:** Refactored to single mount per PVC at /data root level
- **Impact:** All *arr services came up in <30 seconds after refactor
- **Lesson:** Avoid multiple subPath mounts of same PVC; use single mount with subdirectories

**Issue #2: Download Import Failure - Remote Path Mapping (CRITICAL)**
- **Problem:** Downloads completing successfully but failing to import
- **Error:** "Import failed, path does not exist or is not accessible by that user"
- **Root Cause:** qBittorrent uses /downloads/ internally, *arr services expect /data/downloads/
- **Resolution:** Added remote path mappings via API to all *arr services:
  ```bash
  POST /api/v3/remotepathmapping
  {"host": "qbittorrent.media.svc.cluster.local", "remotePath": "/downloads/", "localPath": "/data/downloads/"}
  ```
- **Verification:** Successfully imported "The Lost Bus (2025)" (4.3GB) after mapping
- **Lesson:** Remote path mappings essential when download clients and *arr services mount storage at different paths

**Issue #3: Plex Database Corruption (CRITICAL)**
- **Problem:** Plex pod crash looping with SQLite database corruption
- **Error:** `SQLITE3:0x80000001, 26, file is not a database in "PRAGMA cache_size=512"`
- **Root Cause:** Unknown (possibly NFS write issue or abrupt pod termination)
- **Resolution:** Deleted corrupted media-configs PVC, created fresh PVC
- **Recovery Time:** <2 minutes from PVC deletion to Plex fully operational
- **Lesson:** Fresh PVC creation faster than database repair; Plex recovers cleanly with new database

**Issue #4: MetalLB IP Pool Exhaustion**
- **Problem:** SABnzbd service stuck in `<pending>` state
- **Root Cause:** Requested IP 10.69.1.161 but pool only extended to .160
- **Resolution:** Expanded MetalLB pool to 10.69.1.150-165 (16 IPs total)
- **Lesson:** Always allocate extra IPs in MetalLB pool for future services

**Issue #5: qBittorrent IP Ban**
- **Problem:** "Your IP address has been banned after too many failed authentication attempts"
- **Root Cause:** Multiple incorrect login attempts with default credentials
- **Resolution:** Restarted pod, retrieved temp password from logs (6Tqe98DnT), changed to permanent password
- **Lesson:** Document qBittorrent temporary password retrieval process

### Key Technical Insights

**Kubernetes Service Communication**
- Internal DNS names worked flawlessly: `<service>.media.svc.cluster.local`
- No special networking configuration required beyond MetalLB LoadBalancer
- Pod-to-pod communication via ClusterIP reliable and fast

**PodSecurity Levels**
- LinuxServer.io images require privileged namespace
- Set namespace label: `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=privileged`
- Critical for proper container initialization

**Resource Optimization**
- Plex: 4-8GB RAM, 2-4 CPU cores (transcoding workload)
- NVMe SSD transcoding via emptyDir (performance improvement over NFS)
- Other services: Default limits acceptable (~100-200MB RAM each)
- Total media stack idle: ~1.5GB memory cluster-wide

**Volume Mount Best Practices**
- Single mount per PVC at root level (/data) preferred
- Avoid multiple subPath mounts of same PVC
- Use application configuration for subdirectory paths
- NFS ReadWriteMany (RWX) essential for multi-pod access

**API Integration Workflow**
1. Deploy Prowlarr first (generates API key)
2. Add indexers to Prowlarr
3. Deploy *arr services (auto-generate API keys)
4. Configure Prowlarr â†’ *arr connections in Prowlarr UI
5. Trigger sync (indexers automatically pushed)
6. Add download clients to each *arr service individually

### Tips for Phase 5 (GitOps & Advanced Features)

**Secrets Management Priority**
- Migrate API keys from config files to Kubernetes Secrets
- Use Sealed Secrets or External Secrets Operator
- Current API keys documented in MEDIA_STACK_CONFIG_REVIEW.md for migration

**Backup & DR Considerations**
- Implement automated PVC snapshots (especially media-configs)
- Document PVC corruption recovery procedure (tested successfully)
- Consider velero for backup/restore of media namespace

**Monitoring & Alerting**
- Add Prometheus ServiceMonitors for media services
- Create Grafana dashboard for media stack metrics
- Alert on pod restart loops, high memory usage, download failures

**Performance Tuning**
- Test Plex transcoding with actual streams (NVMe SSD configured, not yet tested)
- Monitor NFS I/O during heavy download activity
- Consider dedicated worker nodes for media workload if needed

**GitOps Workflow**
- All YAML manifests ready for Git repository (deployments/media/)
- ArgoCD can automate deployments from Git
- Implement PR workflow for configuration changes

**Future Service Additions**
- Overseerr: Deployed at 10.69.1.160:5055 (media request management)
- Tautulli: Consider for Plex usage statistics
- Bazarr: Consider for subtitle automation
- MetalLB pool: 8 IPs remaining (.162-.165, .150-.153 unassigned)

### Documentation Artifacts Created
